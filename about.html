    <p>Hey! I’m Sofia and thanks for visiting my website. I am originally from Ukraine, however for about 2 years already I’m living and studying in Lithuania. One year of my life I spent in the United States as part of an exchange program. I was lucky enough to get many valuable experiences and improve my English skills. Besides I have plenty fo international certificates including Flyers, KET, PET, FCE, CAE, TOEFL, etc.

 I have been involved in the tutoring sphere for more than 5 years, during this time I created my own teaching materials as well as the structure of each lesson. All of my students successfully passed international language exams with a high score and also improved their English level. I have my own, unique teaching methods that actually bring results and make my students happy and satisfied.

I am always open to new students and willing to help and support them during their English journey. Don’t hesitate to ask me questions, you can always contact me on social media or sign up for the class on my website.</p>
